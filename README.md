# Data Analyst-Nanodegree Udacity-Projects
## Summary about the projects

## Project1.[Exploring Weathr Trends](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project1_Exploring%20Weathr%20Trends)
* Analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in my home city to overall global temperature trends.
* Produced a visualization and prepared a report describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends of my home city.
* Tool: Excel

## Project2.[Investigate Dataset](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project2_Investigate%20Dataset)
* Analyzed a kaggle dataset containing 100k medical appointments in Brazil, to examine the data characteristics and deduce what are the major factors behind the no show of patients
* Documented the analysis process along with visualizations to explain the findings and support the conclusions drawn.
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project3.[Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project3_Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results)
* A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists
* I was working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My  goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page or keep the old page or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels.api, random, scipy.stats

## Project4.[Wrangling Analyze tweet archive dataset](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project4_Wrangling%20Analyze%20data)
* The dataset that I was wrangling and analyzing and visualizing  the tweet archive , This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017, tweet archive  of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage
* My goal was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, tweepy, json 

## Project5.[Exploration Flights Dataset](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project5_Exploration%20Flights%20Dataset)
* This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I was using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I was producing a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset.
* These dataset for 2000 year that are information about all aspects of the flight for the US, such as departure time, arrival time, departure airport, and arrival airport,and this dataset Contains 5683047 entries and 22 columns. I get Those dataset from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express
